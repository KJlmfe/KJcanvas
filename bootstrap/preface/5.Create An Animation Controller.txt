Suppose move more than one rectangle on canvas and they have self move parameters. We will fall into complex codes if go on previous way. 
So create a simple and convenient interface for animation.</p>
<p>
Here is the interface and conventions.

<dl>
<dt>cmd
({
	a1,b1,c1,
	a2,b2,c2,
	a3,b3,c3,
	...
});
</dt>
<ul>
<li>a* is a string such as "Move","Draw"</li>
<li>b* is an object of shape</li>
<li>c* is an object of animation parameters such as {aim_x:10,aim_y:10,moveSpeed:2}</li>
</ul>
</dl>
</p>
